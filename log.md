### Day 1: June 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a few exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** It's been a bit slow in terms of coding, and I've posted the progress on Wordpress

### Day 2: June 27, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: More HTML stuff that I've merged on my blogpost for Day 1 https://wordpress.com/post/mashalwaq.wordpress.com/34

**Today's Progress**: Back at it and at score 164. 
Manipulate Arrays With unshift
.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

**Today's Progress**: started with 173, ended at: 197
Array stuff to remember:
.shift() removes the first element of an array
.pop() removes the last element of an array

Booleans are true or false, but Boolean values are never written with quotes.
If statements
[Also this tab is open next to the FCC one so I can directly log, instead of saving it later, and forgetting stuff]

=== tests both the data type and value of the compared elements.
!== strict inequality operator, does not convert data types.
with && this is an and statement you can combine a and b if statements
with || this is an or statement and you can combine a or b statements
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.
